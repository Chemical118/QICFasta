QICFasta : Quick Indexing Compresssed FASTA tool
==============

QICFasta (pronounced _Quick-Fasta_) is a tool that compress and decompress the FASTA file by [Huff0 and FSE library](https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy).
Also, index or extract subsequence with compressed FASTA file.

The code inside `/lib` and `/programs` are libraries and not written by me.
